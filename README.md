#Project 6 (agency-style group React application)

Shopper Mapper is an interactive React app that draws on Mapquest.com's API to provide users with information on nearby amenties. Using Mapquest's public data, the app allows users to search for amenities such as cafes or museums, returning an array of options from within a 10km radius. From these results, users can select destinations and receive directions from their current location or from one they enter. Additionally, the app highlights the median option from a given set of results, letting users know which is the most average choice. 

Shopper Mapper was developed by Yuliana Hazda, Allan Blackett, Anny Pham, and Edward Bacal as part of Juno College's Web Development Bootcamp.

## Project Requirements

- Uses React, and no jQuery
- Uses flexbox or grid where appropriate
- Uses Axios and/or Firebase
- Every group member has at least one significant commit on GitHub
- React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs! don't use vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM! .setState() is always-used to alter state!)
- App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop down menu, search field)
- It is clear to the user what the app does
- App and interactions are accessible
- Errors are handled effectively

## Best Practise Requirements:

- Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
- Semantic HTML elements are used properly

- Setup snippet is used
- Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
